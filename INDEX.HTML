<h2>This is a very long paragragrap sooo wait a bit</h2>
<p>I do not love you except because I love you;
    I go from loving to not loving you,
    From waiting to not waiting for you
    My heart moves from cold to fire.
    
   <p>I love you only because it's you the one I love;
    I hate you deeply, and hating you
    Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
    Is that I do not see you but love you blindly.</p> 
    
    Maybe January light will consume
    My heart with its cruel
    Ray, stealing my key to true calm.
